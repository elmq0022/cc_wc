# Coding Challenges - Word Count Tool

## Background

This is my solution to the word count coding challenge located [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-wc).

## Key Learnings

This is a small project.
That means you can focus on the nuances of creating a CLI in Python.

Here's some of the things I got to practice with this project.

1. Python packaging with pyproject.toml
2. Python script entrypoints
3. [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/latest/) for installing Python packages
4. [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) for Python CLI tools
5. As always testing with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)

## Extending the Code

Given the simplicity of the project, there's not a lot of room for extension here.
Still, some things I might consider to go further with this project are:

1. Test Coverage
2. PEP 8 Compliance
3. GitHub CI
4. Release Package
5. Release to pypi
